# Hindi Fake News Classification
The repo consists of attempting to classify fake news using ML models (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest and XGB classifiers), a LSTM model (also attempted with a learning rate schedulers) and using a pre-trained LLM model. 

## Model Accuracies: 
- Random Forest Classification -
- XGBoost Classification -
- Gradient Boosting Classification -
- Bi-Directional LSTM -
- Bi-Directional LSTM with Learning Rate Scheduler and Early Stopping -
- Classification using bert-base-multilingual-cased -
