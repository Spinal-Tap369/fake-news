# Hindi Fake News Classification
The repo consists of attempting to classify fake news using ML models (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest and XGB classifiers), a LSTM model (also attempted with a learning rate schedulers) and using a pre-trained LLM model. 

## Model Accuracies: 
- Random Forest Classification - 73%
- XGBoost Classification - 80%
- Gradient Boosting Classification - 80%
- Bi-Directional LSTM - 84%
- Bi-Directional LSTM with Learning Rate Scheduler and Early Stopping - 82%
- Classification using bert-base-multilingual-cased - 87%
